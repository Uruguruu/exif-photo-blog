# Personalized Vercel EXIF PHOTO-BLOG
This is a photo blog template 📷 that I took from Vercel/Sam Becker and am now adapting for my own needs 🔧. If you’re interested in what I’m changing, feel free to check out the roadmap 🗺️.

## Roadmap
- Photo Variations/Grouping (<https://github.com/sambecker/exif-photo-blog/issues/265> - But a Hold on that)
- Automatic Tagging, via local VISION-MODELS running on OLLAMA. (In general, replace OpenAI stuff with local free stuff. Maybe even GEMINI Free API. IDK.)
- Automatic Multi Upload for efficient photo upload. (Photos get uploaded an automatically Tagged and TItle on mass)
